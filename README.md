# Web-Tic-Tac-Toe
 Tic Tac Toe game made to test my front-end skills.  
 Skills used include CSS Flexbox, jQuery/DOM manipulation, and basic HTML5/CSS3/JS stuff.

## There are three difficulties
 **Easy** - AI randomly selects cells.  
 **Medium** - AI will attempt to win/block in the next turn if it can.  
 **Hard** - AI uses a Minimax algorithm, I don't think it's possible to win against this.
